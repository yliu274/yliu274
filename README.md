* If you are a student who is registered to this class, click on the link that I shared with you. That will create a private Github repository for you. Once you have that repository, clone it to your local by using "git clone". 

* You are supposed to modify the file "my_answers.py" in src/mypkg. You should be able to run this file as you are editing. Any submission that are unable to run properly will get 0 score, including package missing, SyntaxError, variable mismatch, extra return, unnecessary print out, etc.

* Your homework should be submitted to the Github, any delay submission are graded 0.

* You can commit your changes and push your code to your private Github repository. This assignment is auto-graded by pytest, I will push the grading file after deadline, please don't change any file names or function names. Travis-CI will run the tests in the cloud.
